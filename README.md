# hologos' dotfiles

*Based on idea of [carlos' dotfiles](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles).*

> Config files for ZSH, vim, git and more.

## Installation

### Dependencies

First, make sure you have all those things installed:

- `git`: to clone the repo
- `zsh`: to actually run the dotfiles

### Install

Then, run these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hologos/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./installation/bootstrap
zsh # or just close and open your terminal again.
```

> All changed files will be backed up with a `.backup` suffix.

## Docs

If you are interested why I made some decisions or if you want to create your own module, you should read [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) document.
