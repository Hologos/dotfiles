# ADOPTION

This document explains what to do if you want to adopt these dotfiles for your use case.

Ideally you should go through all modules and decide if you want to keep them or not. Also you should go through all files and replace all occurrences of usernames, names, email addresss and replace it with your own. I try to load those from `~/.localrc` as much as possible but it's not always possible reference a shell variable.

## What you definitely have to go through

### README.md

Replace repository link with the one of your fork.

### bin/dot_update

Replace repository link with the one of your fork.

### modules/ssh/config.d/cez

Replace username with your own company username.
